# Simple setup! #
You are just three simple steps away!

## 1. Install this plugin ##
- Best is to use [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/installation)
  + <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> and install
    `EasyClangComplete`

## 2. Install clang ##
- **Ubuntu**: `sudo apt-get install clang`
- **Windows**: install the latest release from `clang`
  [website](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html) (v >= 3.9)
- **OSX**: ships `clang` by default. You are all set!
- on other systems refer to their package managers or install from `clang`
  [website](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html)

## 3. Configure your includes ##

### Using CMake? ###
Plugin will run cmake on a proper `CMakeLists.txt` in your project folder and
will use information from it to complete your code out of the box. You're all
set!

### Have a compilation database? ###
Plugin will search for a compilation database `compile_commands.json` in the
project folder and will load it to complete your code.

If you want to specify a custom path to a comilation database you can do it in settings:
```json
"flags_sources": [
    {"file": "compile_commands.json", "search_in": "<YOUR_PATH>"},
]
```

### None of the above? ###
You will need a little bit of manual setup for now. Please see the following
[instructions][no_cmake].

# You're all set! #
