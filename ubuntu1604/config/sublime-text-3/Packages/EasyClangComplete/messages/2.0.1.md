This release is nearly fully consisting of the pull requests submitted to the
project. Thanks @rchl and @david9991!
- add support for `-isysroot` flag for OSX, fix `-isystem` flag.
- allow wider error popup windows
- open plugin settings side-by-side just like sublime does with its settings
- flags order is now preserved, so the flags are passed to clang in the same
  order as they appear in settings and/or .clang_complete file
- fix the completions being shown in a wrong location after a long completion
  request has finished while the cursor was moved
