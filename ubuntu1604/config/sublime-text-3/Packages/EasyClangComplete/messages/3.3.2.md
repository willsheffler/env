# Bug fixes and improvements #
- Make every action of the plugin use a custom thread pool. Before some parts would use the sublime text internal worker thread. Now everything spawns a separate thread from a pool. Please report if you see regressions.
- Fix blocking other plugins when running long cmake operation.
