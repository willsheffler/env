## Important ##
If something does not work - restart Sublime Text!

# What's new: #
- since Sublime Text version 3123 libclang method should work on Windows with
  clang-3.9. Check it out!
- when using libclang translation units are cleared based on timer to avoid
  taking all your memory in case you have many tabs open.
- thanks to @rchl you don't need to restart Sublime Text in case you changed
  any settings.
- minor fixes

## Thanks ##
Huge thanks go to all the people who contributed their time helping me in
creating this plugin.

It is really important for me that you are using the plugin. If you have
problems - submit issues and we will eventually solve them together.

If you are a developer and care to contribute - you are very welcome!

If you like the plugin and want to help other than by helping shaping it up,
consider supporting the development! It takes me quite some time to implement
everything as good as I can. Find ways to support the plugin here:
