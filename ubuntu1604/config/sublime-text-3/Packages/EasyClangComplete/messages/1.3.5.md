## Thanks ##
Huge thanks go to all the people who contributed their time helping me in
creating this plugin.

It is really important for me that you are using the plugin. If you have
problems - submit issues and we will eventually solve them together.

If you are a developer and care to contribute - you are very welcome!

If you like the plugin and want to help other than by helping shaping it up,
consider supporting the development! It takes me quite some time to implement
everything as good as I can. Find ways to support the plugin here:
