Huge thanks go to all the people who contributed their time helping me in creating this plugin.

Thanks @kpskp77 for reporting the issue!

It is really important for me that you are using the plugin. If you have
problems - submit issues and we will eventually solve them together.

If you like the plugin, consider supporting the development! It takes me quite
some time to implement everything as good as I can. Find ways to support the
plugin here: https://github.com/niosus/EasyClangComplete#support-it
