## Important ##
If something does not work - restart Sublime Text!
### Some known issues ###
- For `Ubuntu 16.04` please instead of installing `clang` install `clang-3.5`.
  There is a non-trivial problem with clang python bindings with `clang-3.8`
  which I am still unable to solve. Please use an older clang version for now.

# What's new: #
- **BIG CHANGE**: if your build system is `CMake` the plugin will generate a
  compilation database and then a file `.clang_complete` near an appropriate
  `CMakeLists.txt` with the flags needed for your project. It will regenerate
  this file if you change anything in `CMakeLists.txt`. The process should be
  completely automatic, but this behavior is still in beta. You can always
  disable it either from settings or when prompted via a dialog.
- Lots of small improvements and bug fixes.

## Thanks ##
Huge thanks go to all the people who contributed their time helping me in creating this plugin.

Thanks Rafał Chłodnicki (@rchl) for his contributions.

It is really important for me that you are using the plugin. If you have
problems - submit issues and we will eventually solve them together.

If you like the plugin, consider supporting the development! It takes me quite
some time to implement everything as good as I can. Find ways to support the
plugin here: https://github.com/niosus/EasyClangComplete#support-it
